Project Cancer

- The images are too varied and a few are mixed
- I think I’ll just work with Calc cases
- Remove large images and see the KDE plot of the length and width of the images
- Modified the CSV to hold two more fields: VALID & AspectRatio. Where valid indicates whether the image can be used at all. (This is to avoid deleting the images, should the need for them arise). We have set the input size of the image to be 224x224;
- So as part of EXPERIMENT 1: I will maintain a square shape (model demands only this or higher). So while resizing, it’s important that the images are not stretched to an abnormal shape; from a rectangular shape to a square one. Rescaling is the best option if stretching is a concern, but they won’t be square.
- Thus the aspect ratio is field I will use to judge the square-ness of an image
- A situation has arisen, I have to wrap the images in a tuple.

- The ImageDataCollector is not accepting the (image,label) tuple.
- Must look at the FastAI documentation for that.
- Not feeling so good about the dataset. It's not complete and may not work at all.
- I have made no attempt at looking at the last model's shortcomings. I am starting from scratch.
- Look into MAML or other meta learning techniques. Therein lies hidden potential.
- But what do I know...

- Ive finally been able to load the model correctly
- It is a Resnet32 model
- I have to write down steps i need to take
- according to lr_find(), i need to set alpha=0.005
- No boost in accuracy with 2 epochs (1 cycle) followed by another cycle of 10 epochs
- 1cy(2) 1cy(10)
- Next ill try data augmentation with last layer and also unfreezing all the layers with differential lr rates.
..... with precompute=False
- Didnt work, there seems to be improvement in val_loss and the accuracy reflects the same;
- hovering around 59~62%
- Will also look into different forms of augmentation and try different techniques.
- Wrap up for the day. Apparently setting the lr at a lower value kept loss minimal but only barely.
- Max accuracy I could get was 67%, with a consistent value at 62%

- It's time I really thought about this project well.
- I'm gonna write down possible ways I can see it working. To the best of my knowledge...

- Strategy 1...
- There are problems in IDing the images. Look at them closely
- See what images are classified correctly and the models confidence on them.
- Similarly, look at the incorrectly classified cases.
- There is code for this available in the fastai repo to compare them side by side.
- Modify it to fit my needs.
- Look for possible irregularities
- Note: How the hell will a model distinguish between the 2 kinds of cases when we cannot...
- ... It is possible that a larger model is required (currently using Resnet34).

- Strategy 2...
- Look at sources where medical images have been used for a pretrained model.
- Next try to implement it
